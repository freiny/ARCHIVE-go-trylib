return the string in reversed order.
return the factorial of it (ie. if num = 4, return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)). For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18.
return the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation and assume sen will not be empty.
str parameter being passed and modify it using the following algorithm. Replace every letter in the string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. c becomes d, z becomes a). Then capitalize every vowel in this new string (a, e, i, o, u) and finally return this modified string.
add up all the numbers from 1 to num. For the test cases, the parameter num will be any number from 1 to 1000.
take the str parameter being passed and capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space.
